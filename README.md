The apper discusses the increased risk of cyber attacks, including malware attacks, due to the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and numerous applications. Basic security standards are risky due to the diverse capabilities of IoT devices, and applying complex security measures is difficult. Artificial immune systems (AIS) are proposed as a solution, as they are portable, adaptable, and capable of detecting malware attacks without prior notice. The paper examines recent developments in the use of AIS to improve malware detection in IoT networks and suggests promising new directions for future research. The text also highlights the serious security concerns raised by widespread connectivity to the cyber world and the large volume of patient data exchanged in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems.
